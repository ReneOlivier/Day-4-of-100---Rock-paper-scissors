# Rock, Paper, Scissors — Day 4 (Angela Yu)

Simple command-line implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game used for Day 4 of the 100 Days of Code course.

## Description

This script runs a small interactive game where the user plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The computer's choice is chosen at random; the program compares choices, announces the round result, and keeps score until the user quits.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+

## How to run

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```
python "Day 4 of 100 - Rock, Paper, Scissors.py"
```

Then follow the on-screen prompts to play.

## Files

- Day 4 of 100 - Rock, Paper, Scissors.py — main game script.

## Skills learned

- Python basics: variables, printing, and reading user input.
- Control flow: `if` / `elif` / `else` for game logic and comparisons.
- Randomness: using the `random` module to generate the computer's choice.
- Loops: `while` loop to run repeated rounds and track game flow.
- Input validation: handling unexpected user input and prompting again.
- Program state: tracking and updating scores across rounds.
- Debugging: testing small interactive programs and fixing logic edge cases.

## Notes / Next steps

- Add unit tests for winner-determination logic.
- Add a best-of-N or score target mode.
